-   Research is becoming more compute intensive
    -   Modeling, simulation, data analysis, data management, etc.
-   Research doesn't necessarily mean "academic"
    -   Most data scientists are doing research
    -   Act on findings instead of publishing them
-   Researchers of all kinds need the equivalent of good laboratory skills for computing
    -   Because software is just another kind of lab equipment
-   The goal of this training is to introduce the minimum set of practices every researcher should have
    -   Frame the training around tools because they facilitate, encourage, and accelerate good practices
-   Drawn from [[Wils2017](#CITE)]
    -   The list is daunting, so this material introduces it piece by piece
