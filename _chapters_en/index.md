These lessons are an introduction to research computing and data analysis
for people with little or no previous training in either.
All content can be re-used and re-mixed under a Creative Commons license ([s:license](#APPENDIX))
and can be viewed on [the material's website]({{site.website}}).
Inspiration comes from:

- [Software Carpentry][swc], [Data Carpentry][dc], and [Library Carpentry][lc]
- [Data Carpentry for Biologists][dcb]
- "Best Practices for Scientific Computing" [[Wils2014](#CITE)]
- "Good Enough Practices in Scientific Computing" [[Wils2017](#CITE)]
- "Ten Simple Rules for Making Research Software More Robust" [[Tasc2017](#CITE)]
- *Practical Computing for Biologists* [[Hadd2010](#CITE)]
- *Effective Computation in Physics* [[Scop2015](#CITE)]

These lessons can be used for self-study by people who plan to enroll in
something like the [Insight Data Science][insight] Fellows Program,
or as a one-semester course for graduate students or senior undergraduates.
If used in the second way,
it assumes 30 contact hours
(i.e., 3 hours/week for 12 weeks minus time for guest speakers, exam prep, and so on).
The pace is based on what [Software Carpentry][swc] and [Data Carpentry][dc] achieve in their two-day workshops,
and on the University of Florida's experience with [Data Carpentry for Biologists][dcb].

Questions, suggestions, and corrections are very welcome:
